A small scripting language running on V8.

## About

This is currently just an experiment. I'm learning more about V8 and the moving parts of the engine, mostly by writing small bits of JavaScript and custom bindings to global functions and objects.

Eventually I'd like to write a terse scripting language that is compiled down to JavaScript and executed on the V8 engine at runtime.
